    "tuit": "Do people still use jQuery? I thought the biggest advantage of this library back in the day was css selector access of DOM nodes (back when we only had getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and getElementsByTagName). This has been rolled into the Javascript document api via document.querySelector, and document.querySelectorAll. Also there are browser compatibility issues that jQuery solved but a lot of these are solved with smaller footprint libraries like lodash. Also for me, along with I'm sure many others, keeping state within the DOM has fallen out of favor of more comprehensible state management inside of JS (like React Hooks, Redux...etc.) What is the current use-case for jQuery? I'm curious from hearing it's current users answer this. "

Dedicated to our work, we find ourselves working long hours and making personal sacrifices in order to follow our passions. Many of these sacrifices include: stipends that do not match our expertise or work hours, lack of childcare, and limited health insurance coverage, among others. We are tired of making unnecessary sacrifices. Joining together across all academic disciplines, we are fighting for the respect and recognition we deserve as both students and workers. With our union, we will stand up for all working graduate students, especially international student workers."

ProPublica has obtained a vast trove of Internal Revenue Service data on the tax returns of thousands of the nation’s wealthiest people, covering more than 15 years. The data provides an unprecedented look inside the financial lives of America’s titans, including Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch and Mark Zuckerberg.

As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices. JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). "
